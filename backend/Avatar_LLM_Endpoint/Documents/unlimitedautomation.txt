Description The workflow involves scanning a provided QR code to extract
product information, verifying it against stored records for accuracy
and compliance, structuring the validated data into a predefined
template, and forwarding the finalized details to the customer for
confirmation. This workflow uses AI to scan vehicle damage from images
submitted during a car insurance claim. It compares the image against
known damage types and coverage rules, determines claim eligibility, and
automatically sends approval details to both the insurer and the
customer. The system extracts invoice data, validates it, classifies
valid invoices, and sends them for approval. If there’s no response
within a set time, a Planner task and reminder are triggered. The system
automatically scrapes product prices across multiple online stores,
compares them with our instore price, and sends a summarized email
highlighting best deals and price differences. AI scans incoming resumes
for required skills, keywords, and experience levels. Qualified
candidates are automatically scheduled for interviews using Microsoft
Teams and notified via email, reducing manual review and coordination
efforts. The system automatically analyses customer feedback using
summarizer tools and generates a visual report that highlights
satisfaction trends, pain points, and actionable insights. These reports
are then shared via email with relevant teams for further action. The
system automates the process of extracting job listings from LinkedIn
based on a user-defined search term. Using Power Automate Desktop, it
collects structured job data such as company name, location, posting
date, role type, and company details. The information is compiled into
an Excel report and sent via email to the user for review and action.
Automates scholarship evaluation by extracting student academic data
from SharePoint forms and certificates using AI Builder. Eligibility is
determined by comparing extracted marks against criteria stored in
Dataverse. The application status is updated accordingly, and students
are notified via email. This automated solution generates personalized
ID cards by combining student or employee data from Excel with profile
photos stored in SharePoint. The information is dynamically populated
into a Word template, converted to PDF format, and saved to a designated
SharePoint document library for secure access and archival. Automates
warranty claim processing by validating uploaded warranty documents and
user queries against product records stored in Dataverse. If a valid
warranty exists, AI Builder categorizes the issue, estimates cost
coverage, and triggers an email with claim details. If expired, the user
receives a notification indicating warranty ineligibility.

Challenges Manual verification delays and human error in product detail
matching Inconsistent data formats across product lines or suppliers
Limited traceability for compliance or recall scenarios Customer
dissatisfaction due to incorrect or delayed product info High
operational overhead for manual templating and dispatch Manual
assessment is slow and inconsistent Human judgment leads to variations
in approval Customers get frustrated by delays High staff workload and
operational bottlenecks High volumes of invoices lead to manual errors
Missing data causes delays and non-compliance Approval bottlenecks due
to unresponsiveness Difficulty tracking pending approvals Prices change
frequently across vendors Manually comparing prices is slow and
error-prone Hard to react quickly to good deals or price drops Sorting
resumes manually takes too long Matching skills accurately is difficult
without automation Coordinating interviews adds more delays Feedback is
scattered across emails, forms, and surveys Manual review misses
patterns or emotional tone Reporting takes time and lacks visual clarity
Job listings are scattered across multiple pages and require scrolling
Manual data collection is time-consuming and error-prone Lack of
structured reporting for job insights Difficulty in tracking newly
posted roles across companies No centralized view of job opportunities
for analysis Student data is scattered across forms and certificates
Manual verification of marks and eligibility is time-intensive Risk of
human error in calculating cutoffs Lack of centralized tracking for
application status Delays in communicating results to applicants Manual
ID card creation is time-consuming Inconsistent formatting and data
entry errors Difficulty managing and storing large volumes of ID files
Limited scalability for bulk generation Manual verification of warranty
